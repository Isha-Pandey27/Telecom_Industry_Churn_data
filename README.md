# Telecom_Industry_Churn_data

This is a case study on the telecom industry customer churned or not.
In this, we will makes Machine Learning Classification model to predict whether the customer churned or not, based on certain features like AccountWeeks, ContractRenewal,DataPlan, DataUsage, CustServCalls, DayMins, DayCalls, MonthlyCharge, OverageFee, RoamMins.

We will start with basic Exploratory data analysis then proceed with the vizualization of Target variable with other independent variables.
Then built the basic decision tree model to understand the flow of data.

Then, build other model using Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and LightGBM. Finally, we compare the accuracy of all the algo's, and find the best one.
